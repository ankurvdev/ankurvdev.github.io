The Remote Terminal application, hereby referred to as the software, uses the SSH protocols to connect to remote servers specified by the user.
The only connections made by the software are those specifically requested by the user by providing either the IP address or the host name of the remote server and the TCP port to connect to.
The identity and user credentials specified for the purpose of establishing the ssh connection are store locally
They are not transmitted for purpose of establishing the ssh connection and only to the hosts that the user specifies.

Please refer to documentation on the SSH protocol to get full information on what client data is implicity sent to the host as part of the 
handshake, but it includes client ip address/port, user credentials and the requested terminal size (calculated based on the screen size).

All other information sent to the remote ssh host is only whats typed into the terminal by user.

No information entered/imported by the user into the application is sent to the author of the software.
